                Move the terms to a second page and only have the sign in with the phone number then the login in button?<br>
                Here is the purpose logic:<br>
                1. The user enters the phone number and clicks the login button<br>
                Note: All user will be pre-entered into the app database, this will be on AWS<br>
                2. Once you logins, the check will be made to the database.<br>
                    If in Database, Fist time user will be direct to the terms and agreements page to agree with a check box.<br>
                    Once they click the box to agree then login we record that to the database with the Device ID in which the login in from.<br> 
                    Once the users signs in record the Device ID, the user can only run the app on one device and only users in the database can access the app<br>
                3. If the users try’s to access the app  that is not in the database will record the phone number and the device ID into a tracking table!<br>
                4. If a user that is already sign up on device and try’s to load the app onto a another device will notify them that the app is already on a device.<br> 
                    And will log that attempt to a tracking table.<br> 
                5. If the users agrees to the terms the if they log out and re-login they will not have to so that again, it will by pass that screen when it does the user check when trying to login<br> 
                6. If the users agrees to the terms the if they log out and re-login they will not have to so that again, it will by pass that screen when it does the user check when trying to login<br> 
                7. If the users agrees to the terms the if they log out and re-login they will not have to so that again, it will by pass that screen when it does the user check when trying to login<br> 
                8. If the users agrees to the terms the if they log out and re-login they will not have to so that again, it will by pass that screen when it does the user check when trying to login<br> 
                9. If the users agrees to the terms the if they log out and re-login they will not have to so that again, it will by pass that screen when it does the user check when trying to login<br>
